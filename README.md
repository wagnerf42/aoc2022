aoc 2022
--------

notable days :

- 1: good example of why itertools rocks
- 5: good example of double borrow
- 7: good example where ownership is a pain
- 8: needs dyn ptr because we need to apply the same op to iter and iter.rev
- 9: did a pseudo polynomial algo. should be possible to do it in poly time but much harder. maybe
a good subject for the algorithms project ?
- 11: multiple borrows of a Vec while iterating mutably on it : back to imperative programming + indices
